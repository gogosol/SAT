# SAT Solver (Python)

This is a Python function named "finish_him()" that takes a single string argument called "formula". The purpose of this function is to evaluate a boolean formula, which can be represented using a combination of boolean operators ('.' for AND, '+' for OR) and variables (represented by single uppercase or lowercase letters).

The function begins by initializing an empty list called "variables" to store all the variables present in the formula. Then, the function iterates through each character in the "formula" string to identify and store all the variables in the "variables" list. During this process, if a variable appears in both uppercase and lowercase in the "formula", it is counted as one variable.

Next, the function initializes several dictionaries ("packing", "contagemv", "only", and "check") and a boolean "veracidade" variable to keep track of the variable assignments, variable counts, and the truth value of each "clause" in the "formula". The "packing" dictionary stores the current assignments of each variable, "contagemv" keeps track of the number of times each variable appears in the "formula", only stores the number of times each variable appears alone in a clause, "check" keeps track of how many clauses each variable appears in, and "veracidade" stores the truth value of each "clause".

The function then splits the "formula" string into a list of clauses, where each "clause" is separated by the '.' character. For each "clause", the function iterates through each variable to determine the variable assignments that would make the "clause" evaluate to True. If both the uppercase and lowercase versions of a variable appear in a clause, the function assigns a True value to the uppercase variable and a False value to the lowercase variable. If only the uppercase version of a variable appears in a clause, the function assigns a True value to the uppercase variable and a False value to the lowercase variable if the variable is not assigned yet, and increments the only and check counters accordingly. Similarly, if only the lowercase version of a variable appears in a clause, the function assigns a True value to the lowercase variable and a False value to the uppercase variable if the variable is not assigned yet, and increments the only and check counters accordingly. If both variables have already been assigned, the function tries to find a consistent assignment for the variables. If no consistent assignment is possible, the function tries to modify the previous variable assignments to find a consistent assignment. If no consistent assignment is possible even after modifying the previous variable assignments, the function assigns a False value to the current "clause" in the "veracidade" dictionary.

After all the clauses have been evaluated, the function then tries to modify the variable assignments to make any false clauses in the "veracidade" dictionary true. If a clause is false because of a missing variable assignment, the function tries to assign the missing variable a True value, and if a consistent assignment is found, the function sets the clause to True in the "veracidade" dictionary. If a consistent assignment cannot be found, the function tries to modify the previous variable assignments to find a consistent assignment.

Finally, the function updates the "conjunto" dictionary with the final variable assignments, sorts the dictionary in ascending order and if the expression it's satifiable, it returns "Satisfiable" and dictionary "conjunto", otherwise, it will return "Unsatisfiable".
